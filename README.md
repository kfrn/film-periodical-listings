### film-periodical-listings

This repo presents listings of cinema periodicals made available online by cultural institutions. Even when online searching is available, it may sometimes be useful to have an overall list of issues (with the link to each).

At the moment, it includes the silent film publications of the Museo Nazionale del Cinema in Torino (Italy), see [here](./mnc).
