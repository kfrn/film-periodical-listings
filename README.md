### film-periodical-listings

This repo presents listings of cinema periodicals made available online by cultural institutions. Even when online searching is available, it may sometimes be useful to have an overall list of issues, with their direct links.

So far, the following collections are included:
- [Riviste e monografie del cinema muto italiano](./mnc) (Museo Nazionale del Cinema, Torino)
- [Publicacions Peri√≤diques](./catalunya) (FilmoTeca de Catalunya)
